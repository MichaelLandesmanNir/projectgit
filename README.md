This repository contains projects I developed as part of my academic studies.

1) Arkanoid Game
    The game is a version of Arkanoid, developed as part of an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course in my undergraduate studies. It features multiple levels with progressively increasing difficulty on a user-friendly platform.
    Implementation Details The game was developed in Java using the IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate IDE, applying several OOP principles: Polymorphism and inheritance. Application of fundamental OOP design patterns, such as Observer, Builder, and more.

    Implementation of graphical user interface (GUI) components. Design Patterns Used

    Builder Design Pattern This pattern was applied to construct different game objects in a systematic way, providing flexibility and simplicity in object creation. Builder classes were designed to create objects such as balls, blocks, boundaries, and paddles, which         ensures the code remains organized, readable, and easy to maintain.

    Observer Design Pattern The Observer pattern was utilized for handling events triggered by various game objects. Game objects act as observables, while listener classes function as observers. These listeners respond to events, such as removing blocks or balls from         the game or updating the score, allowing new listeners to be added without modifying existing game objects, promoting a modular code structure.




3) Youtube
    This project allows users to search for and view YouTube videos on both web and Android platforms. Built with React and styled-components for the web version, and developed using Android Studio with Java/Kotlin for the Android version, our app offers a seamless and responsive experience for users.
    The application includes features such as video search, video playback, user authentication, profile management, and video uploading and editing. This project was developed as part of the Advanced Systems Programming course.

    About the Project This project was created by a team of three members: Michael, Roni, and Lior. Each team member was responsible for different aspects of the application, ensuring a collaborative and comprehensive development process.

    Team Members:
    Michael: Responsible for developing the video page. Michael implemented the video player, video playback, and designed the layout for displaying video details and related videos.

    Roni: Handled the registration and login pages. Roni implemented he login and registration functionalities, ensuring a smooth and safe user experience.

    Lior: Focused on the homepage. Lior developed the main interface of the application, including the search bar, featured videos, and overall layout of the homepage, ensuring it is user-friendly and visually appealing.
